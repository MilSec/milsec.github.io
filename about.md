## MilSec
MilSec is Milwaukee's local [CitySec](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/wiki/meetups/citysec) group. MilSec is here to accomplish two things: Bring people in various Milwaukee area security communities together and help promote local security related groups and events.

Milwaukee has no shortage of security minded people, and no shortage of cool bars/pubs to hang out in. 
MilSec brings local talent together by holding a monthly meetup in a local pub or bar to just hangout.
It also helps promote other area groups and events via the website and [meetup.com](http://meetup.com/milsec).

## Friends of MilSec
We try and promote the following Milwaukee area groups (let [us](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) know if you want to be added to the list):

* [OWASP Milwaukee Chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Milwaukee)

The following Milwaukee area organizations have gone above and beyond to help promote MilSec:
