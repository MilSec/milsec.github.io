MilSec will be meeting at [Rock Bottom Brewery](http://www.rockbottom.com/locations/milwaukee) at 6:00 PM on June, 30th (last Thursday of the month) for food and drinks. As always, anyone is welcome.

Although we don't require an RSVP, it helps to provide a headcount to the restaurant the morning of the event. Just [send us an email](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) if you plan on being there.
