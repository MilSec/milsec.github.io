MilSec will be meeting at [Mo's Irish Pub in Wauwatosa](http://www.mosirishpub.com/wauwatosa/) at 6:00 PM on May, 26th (last Thursday of the month) for food and drinks. As always, anyone is welcome.

Although we don't require an RSVP, it helps to provide a headcount to the restaurant the morning of the event. Just [send us an email](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) if you plan on being there.
