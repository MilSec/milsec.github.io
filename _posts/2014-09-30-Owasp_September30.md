Recently, there has been a new addition to the OWASP Mobile Top Ten Risks. At AppSec California, OWASP debuted the 2014 list and briefly highlighted examples of threats in the new M10 category. In this talk, we discuss the new category in much more depth. This presentation educates the audience about the prevalence of binary risks in both iPhone and Android mobile apps. We will highlight mobile app risks that relate to this new category, as well as others, and how to leverage particular OWASP Projects for the solution. By the end of this talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of binary risk and how to begin thinking about solutions to this mobile app risks.

This talk is by  Matt Clemens. Matt Clemens is a Security Solutions Architect for Arxan Technologies, focusing on application security. Before joining Arxan in 2013 Matt spent 20 years in a variety of roles in the semiconductor and embedded processor industries.
