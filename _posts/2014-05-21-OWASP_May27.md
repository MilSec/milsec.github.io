OWASP will be meeting at the Milwaukee Area Technical College Downtown Campus on May 27th.

Trenton Ivey will be presenting a talk about cryptography and how it has evolved over the years. If you can make it to the talk, you will get to see how to use a bunch of fun pen-and-paper cyphers, and get an overview of some areas of modern day cryptography.
