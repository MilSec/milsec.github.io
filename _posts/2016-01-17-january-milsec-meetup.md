MilSec will be meeting at [Uber Tap Room and Cheese Bar](http://ubertaproom.com/) at 6:00 PM on January, 28th (last Thursday of the month) for food, drinks and hacking. As always, anyone is welcome.

This month we're adding some hands-on hacking into the social. We'll be having a modified [Austin Hacker's Anonymous](http://takeonme.org/rules.html)-style meetup where everyone presents (5-10 mins max) of something they're researching, something new they learned or discuss something they're interested in learning. Be sure to bring your hacking gear!

Although we don't require an RSVP, it'll help us to pick a table and give a headcount to the restaurant the morning of the event. Just [send us an email](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) if you plan on being there.
