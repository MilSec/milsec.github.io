We'll be changing venues this month, bringing the meetup downtown to [Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery](http://www.rockbottom.com/locations/milwaukee). As always, anyone is welcome.

Although we don't require an RSVP, it helps to provide a headcount to the restaurant the morning of the event. Just [send us an email](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) if you plan on being there.
