It's that time of year again.  The holidays are upon us and even the State sponsored boogey men have let up a bit so we can all spend some quality time with the ones we love. Or a good excuse to have a year-end party with arcade games, door prizes, food and drink, and of course other security enthusiasts. Come and have a drink, play an arcade game.  Big shout out to [Checkpoint Systems](https://www.checkpoint.com/) for sponsoring the party and an honorable mention to the YoloSec Framework for just managing not to drool on themselves.

Although we don't require an RSVP, it helps to provide a headcount to the restaurant the morning of the event. Just [send us an email](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) if you plan on being there. Ot check out [meetup.com/milsec](https://meetup.com/milsec)
