# Adding an event
MilSec wants to help bring people from different Milwaukee area security communities together. One way it can do this is by helping to promote other local events. If you want to add a local event to the site, there are a few ways you can do it.

### Option One: Email
The easiest way to add an event to the website is just [email us at info@milsec.org](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) with all of the event details at least one week before you want the event posted. Please include:

* What the event will be about
* When the event will occur
* Where the event will be held
* Who is running the event
* RSVP details (if it is required)
* A paragraph or two detailing the event.

### Option Two: Github 
For the makers/breakers among us, you can use Github to update the site by creating pull requests:

* Make a fork of the [MilSec website](https://github.com/milsec/milsec.github.io)
* Clone the newly created repository to a local system for editing (e.g. git clone https://github.com/<your name>/milsec.github.io)
* Make changes to the website
* Use git to push your changes back to Github (e.g. git push)
* Open a pull request
